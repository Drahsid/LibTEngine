# How was this done, what tools did you use?
To do this, though used various tools, these have been the most helpful: [Project64](https://github.com/project64/project64) for the great in-dev debugger, _the core was in **interpreter** mode_; Ghidra, and by extension [N64LoaderWV](https://github.com/zeroKilo/N64LoaderWV); and [My Fork](https://github.com/Drahsid/mupen64plus-core-wren) of [Mupen64Plus](https://github.com/mupen64plus/mupen64plus-core).
