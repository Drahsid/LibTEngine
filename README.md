# Turok-3-RAM-Map
Archive of things related to the mnemonics and reverse engineering of Turok 3

You can read my findings [here](TUROK3.md)
Alternatively, you can check out look at probably inaccurate [code](code) which I have written to detail these findings.

# What is this?
An archive of my findings from my reverse engineering of Turok 3. I have mostly worked on the US release, however I have used the prerelease versions of the game to learn more about the engine.

**The goal of this _is not_ to be a matching or near-matching decompilation of the game.** Despite that, I may produce both matching, or unmatching code when I am trying to understand the logic of the game.

**The goal of this _is not_ to create a Remaster, Turok3EX, or a PC Port of Turok 3. I am working on this only to learn more about Turok 3.**

# How was this done, what tools did you use?
To do this, though used various tools, these have been the most helpful: [Project64](https://github.com/project64/project64) for the great in-dev debugger, _the core was in **interpreter** mode_; Ghidra, and by extension [N64LoaderWV](https://github.com/zeroKilo/N64LoaderWV); and [Mips To C](https://github.com/matt-kempster/mips_to_c)
